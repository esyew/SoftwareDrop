<a name="l33"><span class="ln">33   </span></a><span class="s0">1.  </span><span class="s2">first, you use some simple macros to describe the interface you want to</span>
<a name="l34"><span class="ln">34   </span></a>    <span class="s2">mock, and they will expand to the implementation of your mock class;</span>
<a name="l35"><span class="ln">35   </span></a><span class="s0">2.  </span><span class="s2">next, you create some mock objects and specify its expectations and behavior</span>

<a name="l47"><span class="ln">47   </span></a><span class="s0">*   </span><span class="s2">The quality of those manually written mocks is a bit, uh, unpredictable. You</span>
